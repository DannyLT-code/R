# R


Leveraging the R software environment for statistical computing and graphics as well as publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomic data, this project investigates the genetic diversity of the virus and its variants. Through comparative analysis of these sequences, we aimed to identify recurring patterns and potential relationships between different strains, conontributing to a deeper understanding of viral evolution.
